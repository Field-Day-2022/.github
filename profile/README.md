## üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è A Short Introduction

The Field Day project is an innovative Wildlife Data Collection and management Tool designed to address field researchers' challenges, particularly those in biology and ecology. The project is developed by a cross-disciplinary team, consisting of a Progressive Web App (PWA) for mobile devices and a web application for larger screens. These tools focus on streamlining data collection, improving offline functionality, and enhancing authentication security through 2-factor Google authentication. The system has been migrated from Amazon Web Services to Firebase for cost-effectiveness. The mobile app facilitates population data collection for various species using capture mark-recapture techniques and offers offline data collection by caching the database locally. The web app allows users to manage, view, and export data dynamically, optimizing performance and reducing costs. Developed using modern technologies like React, Vite, and Tailwind CSS for the front end and Firebase and Firestore for the back end, Field Day represents a scalable, secure, and cost-effective solution for wildlife data collection and analysis.
