# <img src="./logo.svg" alt="Field Day Logo" width="40"> Welcome to Field Day Organization!

The **Field Day Project** is an innovative solution designed to support wildlife researchers in collecting and managing data efficiently. Our tools cater to the unique challenges faced by field researchers, particularly in biology and ecology.

## üåü Introduction

Field Day is built with modern web technologies and includes two key components:
- **[Field Day Mobile Data Collector (MDC)](https://github.com/Field-Day-2022/mobile-data-collector):** Optimized for mobile devices, this app facilitates offline data collection for wildlife population studies using capture-mark-recapture techniques.
- **[Field Day Desktop Data Manager (DDM)](https://github.com/Field-Day-2022/desktop-data-manager):** A desktop-friendly web application designed for managing and exporting collected data.

Both tools are secure, scalable, and cost-effective, leveraging Firebase for backend services and integrating dynamic features such as offline support, advanced authentication, and data export functionality.
