# Field Day Organization - Community Health Files 🌿

This repository contains the default community health files, organization-wide settings, and templates for the Field Day 2022 GitHub organization. These files ensure consistency and provide helpful guidelines for contributors across all repositories within the organization.

## What's Included 📦

### 1. **Profile Settings**
- **`profile/README.md`**: Displays the welcome message and overview for the Field Day organization.
- **`profile/logo.svg`**: The official Field Day logo used across repositories.
- **`profile/mockups.png`**: Mockup images showcasing Field Day tools.

### 2. **Issue Templates** 📝
Custom templates to standardize issue reporting:
- **Bug Reports**: Helps contributors report bugs effectively.
- **Feature Requests**: Guides contributors in suggesting new features or enhancements.

### 3. **Contribution Guidelines** 🤝
- **`CONTRIBUTING.md`**: Detailed instructions for contributors to ensure a smooth and collaborative workflow.

## Profile Overview 🌍

The Field Day organization is committed to developing tools for efficient data collection and management, specifically for wildlife researchers and ecologists. Some of our key projects include:
- **[Mobile Data Collector (MDC)](https://github.com/Field-Day-2022/mobile-data-collector)**: A React-based mobile app for offline wildlife data collection.
- **[Desktop Data Manager (DDM)](https://github.com/Field-Day-2022/desktop-data-manager)**: A web app for managing and exporting collected data.

## How It Works ⚙️

These files serve as defaults for all repositories in the organization:
- If an individual repository doesn’t have specific templates or guidelines, GitHub will automatically use these files.
- Repositories can override these defaults by including their own versions of the templates and settings.

## Acknowledgments 🙏

The Field Day organization is supported by the efforts of ASU students and collaborators, with contributions from capstone teams over multiple years.
